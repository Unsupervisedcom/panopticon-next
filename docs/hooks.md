# Repo hooks — running a script before a task's container starts

A **repo hook** is an executable script the runner runs **on the host**, once per spawn, after it
has prepared a task's workspace but **before** it builds the image and starts the container. Use it
to shape the checkout the agent is about to see — for example, strip host-only config files, drop
in fixtures, or record build state.

It is a per-repo setting: a repo's **`hook_file`** names the script. `None` (the default) means the
repo has no hook.

> `Stop` / `UserPromptSubmit` hooks *inside* the container to track whose turn it is
> (`container/hooks.py`). Those are an internal mechanism, run in the container, and are unrelated

## When it runs

For each task the runner spawns (the Docker container path), in order:

1. Prepare the per-task workspace — a `git clone --local` of the repo, mounted at `/workspace`.
2. **Run the repo hook** (if the repo has one).
3. Compose the task image (base → workflow → repo) and `docker run`.

The hook runs on **whichever host runs the task** (the session service / runner), not inside the
container — the container does not exist yet. Like a repo's `env_file`, the hook is resolved
against that host's own config, so a remote runner uses its own copy of the script.

## Hook vs. image layer — which to use

A repo has two ways to customize what a task runs against: a **hook** (`hook_file`) and an **image
layer** (`image_layer_file`, a Dockerfile fragment composed onto the task image). They solve
different problems — reach for the one whose axis matches your need:

| | **Image layer** (`image_layer_file`) | **Repo hook** (`hook_file`) |
|---|---|---|
| Runs at | image **build** time | **spawn** time, before `docker run` |
| Runs where | inside the image (Linux, `docker build`) | on the **host**, outside the container |
| Runs how often | once per image, then **cached** and reused | **every spawn**, never cached |
| Acts on | the **container image** — tools, packages, system deps | the **per-task workspace checkout** |
| Can see the checkout? | **no** (the clone is mounted at run time, after build) | **yes** (it's the hook's cwd) |
| Effect | baked in, shared by every task on the image | ephemeral, specific to that one task |

**Use an image layer** when you're changing the **environment the agent runs in** — installing a
toolchain (`uv`, `make`, compilers), system libraries, or other files that are the same for every
task on the repo. It's built once and cached, so it's reproducible and cheap per task, and it keeps
that setup isolated inside the container.

**Use a hook** when you need to **touch the specific per-task checkout** before the agent sees it,
or to do host-side work that depends on the task — stripping host-only config out of the clone,
seeding a task-specific fixture, or rewriting the tree. A hook is the only one of the two that can
see the workspace, but it pays that cost on **every** spawn and runs with host privileges outside
the container.

Rule of thumb: if it belongs in the image and is the same for all tasks, make it a **layer**; if it
mutates the checkout or must run per task on the host, make it a **hook**. Prefer a layer when
either works — cached and container-isolated beats per-spawn and host-side. (Neither is the place
for secrets: runtime secrets belong in the repo's `env_file` — see [`auth.md`](auth.md).)

## The execution contract

- **Working directory:** the per-task workspace checkout, so relative paths in the hook resolve
  against the code the agent will work on.
- **Environment:** the runner's environment, plus:
  - `PANOPTICON_TASK_ID` — the task's id.
  - `PANOPTICON_REPO_NAME` — the repo's name.
  - `PANOPTICON_WORKSPACE` — the absolute path to the checkout (same as the cwd).
- **A nonzero exit aborts the spawn.** The hook is a gate: if it fails, the container is never
  started and the task surfaces as `failed` (with the hook's exit status in the detail).
- **A missing or non-executable script is silently skipped.** This lets you register a `hook_file`
  before the script exists (or `chmod -x` it to disable it) without breaking spawns.

## Where the script lives

A `hook_file` is a **name relative to the runner's hooks directory** —
`$PANOPTICON_CONFIG/hooks` (by default `~/.config/panopticon/hooks/`). This mirrors how a repo's
`env_file` resolves against the secrets dir: the stored value is just a name, and each runner
resolves it against its **own** host's hooks dir, so the value stays host-agnostic and works for
remote runners. Names that escape the hooks dir (an absolute path, or `..`) are rejected.

So, to add a hook:

1. **Write the script** under the hooks dir and make it executable:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.config/panopticon/hooks
   $EDITOR ~/.config/panopticon/hooks/strip-host-config.sh
   chmod +x ~/.config/panopticon/hooks/strip-host-config.sh
   ```

   If you run tasks on more than one host, put the script on each host that will run this repo.

2. **Point the repo's `hook_file` at its name** in the dashboard's repo form: open **repos**,
   `n` (new) or `e` (edit) the repo, and on the **general** tab pick the script from the
   **hook_file** dropdown (it lists the names in your hooks dir) — or choose *enter custom path…*
   to type one, which is normalized to a hooks-dir name. Leave it blank for no hook.

## Example hook

A hook that removes a host-only settings file so it never reaches the agent's checkout:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ~/.config/panopticon/hooks/strip-host-config.sh
set -euo pipefail

# cwd is the task's checkout ($PANOPTICON_WORKSPACE).
rm -f .env.local config/host-only.yaml

echo "prepared workspace for task $PANOPTICON_TASK_ID ($PANOPTICON_REPO_NAME)"
```

`stdout`/`stderr` go to the runner's logs. Exit nonzero to abort the spawn.

## Troubleshooting

- **The task went straight to `failed` after preparing.** The hook exited nonzero; check the
  runner's logs for the `repo hook … exited <code>` message and the script's own output.
- **The hook didn't run.** The script is missing or not executable on the host that ran the task,
  or the repo's `hook_file` is unset. A missing/non-executable script is skipped silently by
  design — confirm the path (`$PANOPTICON_CONFIG/hooks/<name>`) and `chmod +x`.
- **The spawn failed with "escapes the hooks dir".** `hook_file` must be a plain name under the
  hooks dir — not an absolute path or one containing `..`.
