"""The layer-store interface — read Dockerfile *layer files* by name (ADR 0005's repo tier).

A repo's image layer is a **file reference** (a name resolved relative to a configured layers
directory), not inline DB content: the task service reads it to serve over REST, and the runner
composes it onto ``base → workflow → repo``. This module owns the read-only store interface; the
filesystem adapter (and its containment-checked name→path resolution) lives in the task service.
